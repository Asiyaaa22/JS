    <h1>JAVASCRIPT CODING QUESTIONS</h1></center>
     <sub>Add two numbers</sub>   
    <p>You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers.</p>

    <center><pre>const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
        return a+b;
    };</pre></center>

    <sub>Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?</sub>
    <p>Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?
        You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.</p>
       <center><pre>const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
            return a<10 && a>b;
          };</pre></center>

    <sub>Check the conditions</sub>
    <p>You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:
       <ol> 
        <li>if both are divisible by 10 console true.</li>
        <li>if both are not divisible by 10 console false.</li>
        <li>if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.</li>
        <li>Use operator to do this.</li></ol></p>
        <center><pre>const Check = (A, B) =>
            {
              if(A%10===0 && B%10===0){
                return "true";
              }
              else if(A%10===0 || B%10===0){
                return "true";
              }

              }
            };
            </pre></center>

        <sub>Find the first digit of a 4 digit number</sub>
    <p>You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.</p>   
        <center><pre>const First_Digit = (n) => {
            var a=n/1000;
            var b=parseInt(a);
            return b;
         };</pre></center>    


         <sub>Find the last digit of a 4 digit number</sub>
        <p>You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.</p> 
            <center><pre>const Last_Digit = (n) => {
            var x = n%10;
            var y = parseInt (x);
            return y;
         };
         </pre></center>

        <sub>Find the remainder</sub>
        <p>You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as  divisor and B as  dividend.Your task is find the remainder.</p>
           <center><pre>const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
            var rmdr = b%a;
            return  rmdr;
        };</pre></center>

        <sub>Multipy two Numbers</sub>
        <p>You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to multiply these two numbers.</p>
            <center><pre>const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => {
                var c = a*b;
                return c;
              };</pre></center>

        <sub>Marks calculator</sub>
        <p>Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as A ,B, and C (out of 100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average</p>
            <center><pre>
                    const Sum = (A, B, C) => 
                    {
                      var marks = A+B+C;
                     return marks;
                    };

                    {
                      var avg = (A+B+C)/3;
